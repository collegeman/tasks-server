# Journal

I'm using this file to document my progress on [tasks-server](../README.md).

I used Loom to record a mock usability study of Motion's onboarding.

In my next session I'll digest this into an Empathy map.

I've been doing this web-based software thing for a long time. When I work on teams, we do things in the necessary 
order: beginning with answering the question, "What problems are we trying to solve?" then designing a solution for 
those problems, and proceeding from there into some cycle of building, testing, and redesigning, until stakeholders 
(but especially users) tell us that we've succeeded.

I woke up this morning reflecting on my journal entry from last night:

> Tomorrow, I'll design the information architecture I'll need for my first version of this thing.

Somehow, when embarking on creating something on my own and for myself, I've decided to cut my legs out
from under me. I think in this I've stumbled onto the first real lesson learned from this project: I have a lot
less discipline when working on my own than when working on a team.

The great news is I can easily pivot here. Today, I'll ~~design the information architecture~~ do the
work of [empathizing with my user](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/): me. As I've thought about it,
a good way to create this opportunity for myself would be to go through the onboarding experiences for some of the
solutions that already exist out there and record myself doing that work.

Today I created the public repository for this project, and I penned a readme to explain the objectives.

Tomorrow, I'll design the information architecture I'll need for my first version of this thing.

Given to the experience I bring with me, I've already picked my stack for the first version:

- Laravel and Breeze
- Inertia and Vue
- MySQL
- Forge and AWS

My hope is that Laravel Cloud will ship before the end of the year, and then I'll use that instead of Forge and AWS.
