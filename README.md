# tasks-server

Manage your tasks, but not too many at a time. Built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com).

## About this project

This project will be successful if it empowers me to achieve these objectives:

- [x] I need to stop wondering if I can build a better mousetrap
- [x] I need to have a recent project in my portfolio that exhibits my skills
- [ ] I need to get my tasks out of my head and into the cloud
- [ ] I need to plan my big goals and track the progress I'm making
- [ ] I need this system to be designed to protect me from burning myself out
- [ ] I need to be planning tomorrow before I finish today, so that I can rest
- [ ] I need to regard meetings as work and allocate time for them
- [ ] I need to leverage AI as much as possible
- [ ] I want to be able to use my voice to manage all this meta-work

## How we got here

A bajillion developer years ago, I was working at an [awesome company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squidoo) with some 
[really](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreybrown/), [really](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeyblake/), 
[great](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilhildebrand/) [people](https://www.linkedin.com/in/megancaseyahern/). We spent a 
lot of time thinking about and working toward being maximally productive.

In that relentless pursuit of [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done), several 
discoveries were made. First, digital task management can be [beautiful](https://culturedcode.com/things/). Second,
digital task management can lead to [burnout](https://coreybrown.me/productivity/to-do-list-stress-and-a-return-to-paper/).
Third, [paper task lists](https://www.corbinizer.com/) can restore your sanity. 

While all of that growth was going on, some [big changes happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda) at 
Google, the awesome company we had been building was sold, and our teammates moved on.

(Incidentally, one bajillion developer years is approximately one normal-human decade, in case you were wondering.)

While I've continued in my pursuit of maximum productivity, I've primarily had to do that work within teams that
had various preconceived [preferences](https://basecamp.com/) for [managing](https://monday.com/) 
[tasks](https://clickup.com/). All of these tools embody strongly held opinions about how the information of my work 
should be organized, and that's all fine. But none of them have ever felt right for me, and that's a problem worth 
solving.

As I write this, I find myself at a sort of professional and personal crossroads. My daughter is almost grown. The 
[new company](https://accessvr.com) I've been helping build for the last four years is approaching a major milestone,
maybe. And maybe I'm looking out at the horizon and wondering what's next. No matter what the next thing is,
I'll be bringing my ambition with me.

One question remains: How will I manage the journey?

## Am I just recreating wheel?

Almost certainly, [yes](https://www.google.com/search?q=task+management+app), but with purpose.

In the years since my time at that awesome company, there have easily been dozens of new task and project management 
tools to come online. The marketing for some of them, like [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/) and 
[Reclaim](https://reclaim.ai/), sometimes seem to be speaking directly to the problems I'm trying to solve.

The critical justifications I have for moving forward are:

- I'm not building something for a team (not yet), just for me and my friends
- I don't want to learn someone else's system, I want to embrace my own idiosyncrasies
- I expect to learn a few important things along the way, especially about AI/LLMs
- Doing this work in public is a powerful way of marketing my skills and building some new ones

The only way out is through.
