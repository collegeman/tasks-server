Today I created the public repository for this project, and I penned a readme to explain the objectives.

Tomorrow, I'll design the information architecture I'll need for my first version of this thing.

Given to the experience I bring with me, I've already picked my stack for the first version:

- Laravel and Breeze
- Inertia and Vue
- MySQL
- Forge and AWS

My hope is that Laravel Cloud will ship before the end of the year, and then I'll use that instead of Forge and AWS.
